## Developement Instructions

## Developement Commands
Below are a list of commands used for developement. The logic for all the commands are in the local `package.json`
- `npm start` - starts a server hosting the webapp on localhost using budo; will live update with changes
- `npm run build` - builds a final distributable using browserify
- `npm test` - runs tests in jasmine
